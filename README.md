LCS String Finder in Binary Files

This project is a Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) implementation in C, specifically designed to find the LCS between strings extracted from binary files. The program reads binary files, extracts string data, and computes the LCS between them.
Features

    Binary File Handling: Reads input directly from binary files.
    String Extraction: Extracts and processes string data from the files.
    Efficient LCS Algorithm: Implements a dynamic programming solution to compute the Longest Common Subsequence.
    Modular Design: Separates file handling, string processing, and LCS computation for clarity and reusability.
